# Task 01: Implement Caesar Cipher

This repository contains the implementation of the Caesar Cipher as part of my virtual internship at Prodigy Infotech. The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Task Details

**Objective:**
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The program should allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Shift letters in the input message to encrypt the text.
- **Decryption**: Reverse the shift to decrypt the text back to the original message.
- **User Input**: Allow users to input the message and the shift value.

## Output

Here are the screenshots of the output generated by the program:
